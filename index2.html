    <h1>Fast Food</h1>
    <h2>Fast food, also called junk food, is a food that is low in nutrients, but high in calories and highly processed.  Fast food is high in saturated fats and added sugars. Some researchers believe that fast food is as addictive as substances such as alcohol or drugs. 

    <h3>Long-time effects</h3>
    <h4>Long effects of  eating a diet that is high in fast foods and junk food increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, depression, digestive issues, type 2 diabetes, cancer and finally an early death. Frequency of consumption matters in the effects. Studies on the consumption of fast foods found that having fast food more than once a week has already increased the risk of obesity. Eating fast food more than twice a week was associated with a heightened risk of a metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease.</h4>   
    <h5>Short-time effects</h5>
    <h6>Some of the effects of eating fast food for a short period of time include a changed metabolism. Eating fast food for five days can cause muscles to lose their ability to turn glucose into energy. Eating fast food for just a few days can lead to digestive problems and constipation. A single fast food meal can lead the arteries to narrow, which in turn increases the blood pressure. Fast food also can cause a surge in insulin, which will lead to a quick drop in blood sugar that will cause a malaise feeling. One dish of fast food can increase inflammation in the body.<h6>
